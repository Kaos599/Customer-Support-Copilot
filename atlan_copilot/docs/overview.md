# Project Overview: Atlan Customer Support Copilot

## 1. Introduction

I have developed the Atlan Customer Support Copilot as an advanced AI-powered system to streamline and enhance the customer support process at Atlan. Throughout this project, I leveraged state-of-the-art language models and implemented a comprehensive Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline. My system provides support engineers with powerful tools to automate ticket classification, retrieve relevant information from internal knowledge bases, and assist in generating accurate, context-aware responses.

My primary goal in creating this project was to reduce response times, improve the consistency and quality of support, and free up support engineers to focus on more complex, high-value customer interactions. I designed the entire system with scalability and maintainability in mind.

## 2. Core Features

I built the copilot around **seven main functional pillars** that I carefully designed and implemented, all now **fully operational**:

### a. Automated Ticket Classification
When I implemented the ticket classification system, I ensured that upon receiving any new support ticket (whether from a user query in the chat interface or from a database), my system automatically classifies it based on three key criteria that I identified as most important:
- **Topic**: I designed this to identify the primary subject of the ticket (e.g., `Connector`, `Lineage`, `API/SDK`).
- **Sentiment**: I implemented sentiment analysis to gauge the user's emotional state (e.g., `Frustrated`, `Curious`).
- **Priority**: I created a priority assignment system that assigns an initial priority level (e.g., `P0 (High)`, `P1 (Medium)`) based on the urgency and potential impact described in the ticket.

Through this automated classification that I developed, I enabled faster routing of tickets to the correct teams and helped prioritize critical issues.

### d. Unified Ticket Storage and Advanced Analytics
I implemented a comprehensive unified data persistence layer that stores all ticket data in a single MongoDB collection with rich metadata and advanced analytical capabilities:
- **Unified Ticket Schema**: All tickets are stored in a single `tickets` collection with a `processed` boolean field. When `processed=true`, classification results, confidence scores, and processing metadata are embedded directly in the ticket document.
- **Manual Processing Control**: Users have full control through dedicated buttons: Add Tickets (CSV/JSON upload), Fetch New Tickets (multiple modes), and Process Tickets (batch processing options).
- **Advanced Fetch Functionality**: Multiple fetch modes including "Since Last Fetch", "Last 24 Hours", "Last 7 Days", and "All Unprocessed" with session state tracking.
- **Batch Processing Options**: Process all unprocessed tickets, process by priority level, process by count limit, or process specific ticket selections.
- **Comprehensive Analytics**: Real-time dashboard with key metrics, processing status visualizations, priority/sentiment distribution charts, topic analysis, and time-based trends.
- **Advanced Filtering**: Multi-select filters for priority and sentiment, date range filtering, and text search across ticket content.
- **Historical Analytics**: Complete audit trail of all ticket classifications with timestamps, model versions, confidence scores, and processing statistics.

### b. Intelligent RAG Pipeline
For queries that require factual information, I implemented a powerful RAG pipeline that I'm particularly proud of. I connected this pipeline to a vector database containing indexed and searchable content from Atlan's official documentation (`docs.atlan.com`) and developer portal (`developer.atlan.com`).

When a user asks a question, my RAG agent follows this process that I designed:
1. I generate an embedding of the user's query using Google's Gemini embedding models.
2. I perform a similarity search against the vector database to find the most relevant documentation snippets.
3. I provide this context to my response generation model, ensuring that answers are grounded in factual, up-to-date information.

### c. Assisted Response Generation
The final component I implemented is a response generation agent that synthesizes the information retrieved by my RAG pipeline into a coherent, human-readable answer. I designed this agent to:
- Answer questions using only the provided context to ensure accuracy.
- Cite its sources by providing direct links to the documentation I indexed.
- Acknowledge when it doesn't have enough information to provide a definitive answer, maintaining transparency.

### d. Advanced Ticket Management System
I implemented a comprehensive ticket management system with advanced features:
- **Clickable Tickets**: Each ticket card is clickable and opens a detailed view
- **Multipage Navigation**: Seamless navigation between tickets view and detailed ticket pages
- **AI-Powered Resolution**: Automated ticket resolution using RAG for eligible topics
- **Team Routing**: Intelligent routing to appropriate teams for non-RAG topics
- **Detailed Analysis Display**: Complete AI analysis with confidence scores and metadata

### e. Enhanced User Interface
I created a sophisticated user interface with multiple views:
- **Dashboard**: Analytics and batch processing capabilities
- **Tickets View**: Card-based layout with advanced filtering
- **Ticket Detail View**: 4-tab comprehensive ticket analysis
- **Chat Interface**: Real-time AI conversations with citations
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly across devices

### f. Comprehensive Knowledge Base Integration
I integrated multiple knowledge sources for comprehensive coverage:
- **Atlan Documentation**: Primary knowledge base at https://docs.atlan.com/
- **Developer Hub**: Technical documentation at https://developer.atlan.com/
- **Vector Database**: Optimized storage with Qdrant for fast retrieval
- **Semantic Chunking**: Intelligent document segmentation for better context

### g. Production-Ready Architecture
I designed the system with enterprise-grade features:
- **Unified Database Schema**: Single collection with embedded processing data
- **Advanced Analytics**: Real-time statistics and comprehensive reporting
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error recovery and user feedback
- **Performance Optimization**: Optimized queries and responsive UI
- **Scalability**: Designed to handle enterprise workloads

## 3. High-Level Workflow

I designed my system to operate as a multi-agent system orchestrated by LangGraph, which I chose for its superior state management capabilities. Here's how I structured a typical user query flow:
1. **Input**: A user submits a query to my system.
2. **Classification**: My `ClassificationAgent` analyzes the query to determine topic, sentiment, and priority.
3. **Retrieval**: My `RAGAgent` searches the vector database I populated for relevant documentation.
4. **Generation**: My `ResponseAgent` uses the retrieved context to generate a citable answer.
5. **Output**: I present the final response to the user with proper citations and transparency.

I chose this structured, multi-agent approach to ensure that each step of the process is handled by a specialized component that I carefully tuned, leading to a more robust and accurate system. Through extensive testing, I validated that this architecture provides the reliability and performance needed for production use.
