# Project Overview: Atlan Customer Support Copilot

## 1. Introduction

I have developed the Atlan Customer Support Copilot as an advanced AI-powered system to streamline and enhance the customer support process at Atlan. Throughout this project, I leveraged state-of-the-art language models and implemented a comprehensive Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline. My system provides support engineers with powerful tools to automate ticket classification, retrieve relevant information from internal knowledge bases, and assist in generating accurate, context-aware responses.

My primary goal in creating this project was to reduce response times, improve the consistency and quality of support, and free up support engineers to focus on more complex, high-value customer interactions. I designed the entire system with scalability and maintainability in mind.

## 2. Core Features

I built the copilot around three main functional pillars that I carefully designed and implemented:

### a. Automated Ticket Classification
When I implemented the ticket classification system, I ensured that upon receiving any new support ticket (whether from a user query in the chat interface or from a database), my system automatically classifies it based on three key criteria that I identified as most important:
- **Topic**: I designed this to identify the primary subject of the ticket (e.g., `Connector`, `Lineage`, `API/SDK`).
- **Sentiment**: I implemented sentiment analysis to gauge the user's emotional state (e.g., `Frustrated`, `Curious`).
- **Priority**: I created a priority assignment system that assigns an initial priority level (e.g., `P0 (High)`, `P1 (Medium)`) based on the urgency and potential impact described in the ticket.

Through this automated classification that I developed, I enabled faster routing of tickets to the correct teams and helped prioritize critical issues.

### b. Intelligent RAG Pipeline
For queries that require factual information, I implemented a powerful RAG pipeline that I'm particularly proud of. I connected this pipeline to a vector database containing indexed and searchable content from Atlan's official documentation (`docs.atlan.com`) and developer portal (`developer.atlan.com`).

When a user asks a question, my RAG agent follows this process that I designed:
1. I generate an embedding of the user's query using Google's Gemini embedding models.
2. I perform a similarity search against the vector database to find the most relevant documentation snippets.
3. I provide this context to my response generation model, ensuring that answers are grounded in factual, up-to-date information.

### c. Assisted Response Generation
The final component I implemented is a response generation agent that synthesizes the information retrieved by my RAG pipeline into a coherent, human-readable answer. I designed this agent to:
- Answer questions using only the provided context to ensure accuracy.
- Cite its sources by providing direct links to the documentation I indexed.
- Acknowledge when it doesn't have enough information to provide a definitive answer, maintaining transparency.

## 3. High-Level Workflow

I designed my system to operate as a multi-agent system orchestrated by LangGraph, which I chose for its superior state management capabilities. Here's how I structured a typical user query flow:
1. **Input**: A user submits a query to my system.
2. **Classification**: My `ClassificationAgent` analyzes the query to determine topic, sentiment, and priority.
3. **Retrieval**: My `RAGAgent` searches the vector database I populated for relevant documentation.
4. **Generation**: My `ResponseAgent` uses the retrieved context to generate a citable answer.
5. **Output**: I present the final response to the user with proper citations and transparency.

I chose this structured, multi-agent approach to ensure that each step of the process is handled by a specialized component that I carefully tuned, leading to a more robust and accurate system. Through extensive testing, I validated that this architecture provides the reliability and performance needed for production use.
